# parallaxMap
An experiment with parallax map

Here the source code of the  experiment visible at address: [aperricone.altervista.org/algorithms/parallaxMap/index.html](aperricone.altervista.org/algorithms/parallaxMap/index.html).

Here implement the parallax map, trying to improve it, adding a better control on depth and UV management.

## TODO
I plan to include a support to Depth write so it can be used with shadow map and with model overlapping.
Actually the depth written is the outer.

I plan to include a Sphere demo.

In a descktop version the plane uniform parameter can be stored in a vertex buffer.

Antonino Perricone
